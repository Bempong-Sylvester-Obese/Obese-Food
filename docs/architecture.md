# Obese Food Architecture

## Overview
Obese Food is a mobile application that leverages AI-powered food image recognition to analyze meal components and provide nutritional insights. The app features a gamified system where users earn Oex points for meeting dietary goals and promotes healthier eating habits.

## System Architecture

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Frontend (Mobile Application)**
- **Platform**: iOS (Swift + SwiftUI)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **State Management**: Combine
- **Navigation**: SwiftUI NavigationStack
- **Data Storage**: CoreData (for local caching)
- **APIs Used**:
  - Camera & Photo Library Access (for food image input)
  - AI/ML Model Integration (CoreML/TensorFlow Lite)
  - Firebase Authentication & Firestore

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Backend**
- **Cloud Service**: Firebase
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (Email, Google Sign-in, Apple Sign-in)
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Storage**: Firebase Cloud Storage (for storing images)
